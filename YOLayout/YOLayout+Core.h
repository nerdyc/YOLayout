/*!
 Block containing logic to layout or size the current view, with the specified
 size as a hint. Return the size used.

 You should never setFrame on subviews in this block. Instead use the methods
 in layout in order to setFrame, and use what those methods return to layout other
 subviews. This is because setFrame calls are no-ops when the view is only sizing.

 @param layout Layout
 @param size Size to layout in
 @result Size of the view being laid out

/*!
 YOLayout is a way to size and layout views without having to implement layoutSubview and
 sizeToFit separately.

 It also provides a basic cache to avoid layout when the view is unchanged.

 YOLayout calculates a size that best fits the receiverâ€™s subviews,
 without altering the subviews frames, or affecting layoutSubviews call hierarchy.

 Instead of defining both sizeThatFits: and layoutSubviews, you create a block named layoutBlock.
 In this block you use the layout instance to set the subview frames (if sizing).

 This prevents your code from altering subviews when you are sizing (for sizeThatFits:).

 For example,

 CGRect titleLabelFrame = [layout setFrame:CGRectMake(x, y, 400, 0) view:_titleLabel options:YOLayoutOptionsSizeToFit];
 // titleLabelFrame may have a different width and will have a valid height

 You can combine YOLayoutOptionsSizeToFit and YOLayoutOptionsCenter to have it be centered with a variable height.
 For example,

 CGRect titleLabelFrame = [layout setFrame:CGRectMake(x, y, 400, 0) view:_titleLabel options:YOLayoutOptionsSizeToFit|YOLayoutOptionsCenter];
 // titleLabelFrame may have a different width and will have a valid height and will have an x position so it is centered

 You can also combine YOLayoutOptionsSizeToFit with YOLayoutOptionsConstraintWidth
 to make sure the width isn't set larger than expected. For example,

 CGRect titleLabelFrame = [layout setFrame:CGRectMake(x, y, 400, 0) view:_titleLabel options:YOLayoutOptionsSizeToFit|YOLayoutOptionsConstraintWidth];
 // titleLabelFrame may have a different width but it won't be larger than 400

 You can combine YOLayoutOptionsSizeToFit, YOLayoutOptionsConstraintWidth, and YOLayoutOptionsDefaultWidth to make sure
 a view sizes to fit with max and default width (when 0).
